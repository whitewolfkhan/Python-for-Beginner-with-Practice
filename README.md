# Python Core Concepts Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created to practice and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each file focuses on a specific area of Python, from basic syntax to more advanced features.

## Overview

The scripts cover a variety of topics essential for any Python developer, including:
- Basic control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- File and directory management
- Functions and modular code
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes
- Advanced concepts like lambdas and list comprehensions
- A simple project ( Custom build Command Line Task Manager)

## File Descriptions

Here is a breakdown of what each script demonstrates:

* `controlFlow.py`: Examples of `if-else` statements, `for` and `while` loops, a prime number checker, and a menu-driven calculator.
* `Dictionary.py`: Covers dictionary creation, manipulation, iteration, and dictionary comprehensions. Includes a word frequency counter.
* `Arrays.py`: Demonstrates list manipulation, including indexing, slicing, appending, removing elements, and multidimensional lists.
* `ClassAndObject.py`: A simple introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a `MycomplexNumber` class, constructor (`__init__`), and methods.
* `File.py`: Shows how to perform file operations like reading, writing, and appending. It also includes exception handling and using the `logging` module.
* `directory_fileManagement.py`: Examples of using the `os` and `sys` modules to interact with the operating system for directory and file management.
* `ForProjectWork.py`: Contains examples of Pythonic code practices, including list comprehensions, `lambda` functions, and the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate into the repository's directory.
3.  You can run any of the `.py` files using a Python interpreter. For example:
    ```bash
    python controlFlow.py
    ```
