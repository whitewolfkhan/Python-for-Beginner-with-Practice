# Python Core Concepts and Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created to practice and demonstrate fundamental and intermediate programming concepts. It ranges from basic syntax and data structures to a complete command-line task manager application. Each file focuses on a specific area of Python.

## Overview

The scripts cover a variety of topics essential for any Python developer. The repository now includes:
- A complete command-line task manager project.
- In-depth examples of all major data structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
- Scripts demonstrating file I/O, directory management, and data serialization (JSON/CSV).
- Examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), custom iterators, and Pythonic features like lambdas.
- A reference script for most of Python's built-in keywords.

## File Descriptions

Here is a breakdown of what each script demonstrates:

* `SampleFirstProject.py`: A complete command-line task manager application. It demonstrates file I/O, data management with dictionaries, and exporting data to JSON and CSV formats.
* `Keyword_and_Identifiers.py`: A reference script that demonstrates the usage of many of Python's built-in keywords like `in`, `yield`, `lambda`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `assert`, etc.
* `Strings.py`: A comprehensive look at string manipulation, including formatting, methods, and using regular expressions (`re` module) for tasks like text cleaning and validation. 
* `Tupples.py`: Focuses on the tuple data structure, highlighting its immutability, use cases, methods, and built-in functions. 
* `Sets.py`: Covers the creation and manipulation of sets and frozensets, including mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
* `Iterator.py`: Explains Python iterators, including how to create custom iterator classes using `__iter__` and `__next__`. 
* `ClassAndObject.py`: An introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a simple class, constructor (`__init__`), and methods.
* `controlFlow.py`: Examples of `if-else` statements, `for` and `while` loops, a prime number checker, and a menu-driven calculator.
* `Dictionary.py`: Covers dictionary creation, manipulation, iteration, and dictionary comprehensions.
* `Arrays.py`: Demonstrates list manipulation, including indexing, slicing, appending, removing elements, and multidimensional lists.
* `File.py`: Shows how to perform file operations like reading, writing, and appending, along with exception handling and logging.
* `directory_fileManagement.py`: Examples of using the `os` and `sys` modules to interact with the operating system for directory and file management.
* `ForProjectWork.py`: Contains examples of Pythonic code practices, including list comprehensions, `lambda` functions, and the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate into the repository's directory.
3.  You can run any of the `.py` files using a Python interpreter. For example:
    ```bash
    python Strings.py
    ```
4.  The `SampleFirstProject.py` script is a standalone application. Run it to manage a list of tasks which will be saved to `task.txt`.
    ```bash
    python SampleFirstProject.py
    ```
